{"coordinates":"pkg:maven/biz.aQute.bnd/biz.aQute.remote.launcher@7.1.0","description":"A launcher for the bnd launch architecture. This JAR contains a Launcher-Plugin. This plugin is found when you put this JAR on the -runpath of a launch specification in either a bndrun or bnd file. This launcher will read the -runremote header and contact a remote agent. The remote agent can be either a biz.aQute.remote.main, which will run as main, or a biz.aQute.remote.agent, which will run as a bundle. This JAR contains the agent so if the remote agent is a main then it will install the agent in this JAR.","reference":"https://ossindex.sonatype.org/component/pkg:maven/biz.aQute.bnd/biz.aQute.remote.launcher@7.1.0?utm_source\u003ddependency-check\u0026utm_medium\u003dintegration\u0026utm_content\u003d10.0.3","vulnerabilities":[],"sonatypeOssiScore":0.0}
