This issue occurs when the parseProxyProtocolV1 method processes multiple requests on the same HTTP connection. As a result, different requests may share the same StringBuilder instance, potentially leading to information leakage between requests or responses. In some cases, a value from a previous request or response may be erroneously reused, which could lead to unintended data exposure. This issue primarily results in errors and connection termination but creates a risk of data leakage in multi-request environments.","cvssScore":7.5,"cvssVector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","cwe":"CWE-362","cve":"CVE-2024-7885","reference":"https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/CVE-2024-7885?component-type\u003dmaven\u0026component-name\u003dio.undertow%2Fundertow-core\u0026utm_source\u003ddependency-check\u0026utm_medium\u003dintegration\u0026utm_content\u003d10.0.3","externalReferences":["http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId\u003dCVE-2024-7885","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7885"]}],"sonatypeOssiScore":0.0}
