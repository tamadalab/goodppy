It is easy for machines to parse and generate.\n    It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition\n    - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses\n    conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#,\n    Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.\n    These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.","reference":"https://ossindex.sonatype.org/component/pkg:maven/org.json/json@20231013?utm_source\u003ddependency-check\u0026utm_medium\u003dintegration\u0026utm_content\u003d10.0.3","vulnerabilities":[],"sonatypeOssiScore":0.0}
